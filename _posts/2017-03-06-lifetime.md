title: Map of a Lifetime
---

Today let's look on a small thing. Let's say (for the sake of simplicity, the
actual algorithm comes up more often than you'd think) you want to do some
contest, so you need to select any combination of two teams out of your list.
To make it even more simple, let's ignore teams and just focus on indices. You
might write:

```rust
const TEAMS : usize = 6;

fn main() {
    for (a, b) in (0..TEAMS).flat_map(|a| (0..a).map(|b| (a, b))) {
        compete(a, b)
    }
}
```

However, Rust does not like this:

<pre class="highlight">
<span class="gr">error</span><b>: `a` does not live long enough</b>
<span class="nb"> --></span> combine.rs:4:59
<span class="nb">  |</span>
<span class="nb">6 |</span>     for (a, b) in (0..TEAMS).flat_map(|a| (0..a).map(|b| (a, b))) {
<span class="nb">  |                                                      ---</span>  <span class="gr">^</span>    <span class="nb">- borrowed value only lives until here</span>
<span class="nb">  |                                                      |</span>    <span class="gr">|</span>
<span class="nb">  |                                                      |</span>    <span class="gr">does not live long enough</span>
<span class="nb">  |                                                      capture occurs here</span>
<span class="nb">7 |</span>         compete(a, b)
<span class="nb">8 |</span>     }
<span class="nb">  |     - borrowed value needs to live until here</span>

error: aborting due to previous error
</pre>

So, what does this tell us? As you can imagine, I was a bit stumped. Isn't
`usize` `Copy`? Why is it borrowing at all? Taking a step back, the *capture*
(the first span in the error message) appears to constitute a borrow, which the
borrow checker cannot work out.

So what to do? We don't *need* to borrow, and I just remembered that closures
can *move*. So we change the `map` closure to `move |b| (a, b)` and borrowck is
happy.

However, is this really a good way to do this? Let's benchmark against a naive
double loop (I'm going to use nightly's *test* feature so I don't need to setup
a crate):

```rust
#![feature(test)]
extern crate test;
use test::{Bencher, black_box};

const TEAMS : usize = 6;

#[bench]
fn bench_flat_map(b: &mut Bencher) {
    b.iter(||
        for (a, b) in (0..TEAMS).flat_map(|a| (0..a).map(move |b| (a, b))) {
            black_box((a, b));
        }
    );
}

#[bench]
fn bench_nested_loops(b: &mut Bencher) {
    b.iter(||
        for a in 1..TEAMS {
            for b in 0..a {
                black_box((a, b));
            }
        }
    );
}
```

Let's compile and run it:

<pre class="highlight">
$ rustc --test -C opt_level=3 -C lto -C target-cpu=core2 compete.rs
$ ./compete --bench

running 2 tests
test bench_flat_map     ... <span class="vg">bench</span>:          64 ns/iter (+/- 0)
test bench_nested_loops ... <span class="vg">bench</span>:           6 ns/iter (+/- 0)

test result: <span class="sr">ok</span>. 0 passed; 0 failed; 0 ignored; 2 measured
</pre>

Ouch. More than 10 times the execution time of a naive nested loop. Well, we
all know that it pays to keep code simple. Even with a larger number of `TEAMS`
we see the `flat_map` version lagging behind (though it's catching up
eventually). Looking into the assembly shows that the nested loops were fully
unrolled whereas the `flat_map` version was left as an exercise to a MIR
optimizer. Perhaps this should be seen as an LLVM bug.

On the upside, the `flat_map` version is easier to abstract over than the
nested loops (although using a higher-order function would make perfect sense
here).
