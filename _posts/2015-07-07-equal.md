title: All Languages are Equal (but Different)
---

With this post I want to explore the reasons why I think Turing Equivalence is 
way overhyped and show why [Rust](http://rust-lang.org) is on some levels more 
powerful than Haskell, Python, Java, C, or Assembly.

There have been many attempts to define the "power" of programming languages,
though all I've seen so far are either wrong or (intentionally or by accident)
blurry.

One level to look at is 
[Turing-Completeness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness). I
won't go there because the languages I intend to compare are all already 
Turing-complete. Apart from that, the perhaps most notorious attempt to define
"Power" comes from Paul Graham's essay 
[Beating the Averages](http://paulgraham.com/avg.html). His 'Blub paradox' in
one fell swoop equates power with abstraction, and makes it a psychological
issue: If your chosen language is less powerful, you aren't able to *think*
more powerfully.

Apart from the general fuzzyness of his argument, I think the correlation his 
argument hinges on is incidential. His point that Lisp is much more powerful 
than other languages because "programs writing programs" is made moot by one 
classic counterexample: There are a lot of Brainfuck programs writing other 
Brainfuck programs to do things, yet no one would argue that Brainfuck be as 
powerful as Lisp.

As an aside, there are a few libraries that mangle Java Byte Code, which one 
can use to effectively write code at runtime. Sure, they may not be as easy to 
use as Lisp's `defmacro`, but they get the same thing done. Rust has a hygienic
macro facility you can use for simple cases, and it is possible to write 
compiler plugins for complex ones (though this requires unstable APIs). If all 
else fails, you can write a program that writes another program in just about 
any language (as per the example above).

So what is "power"? Regarding programming languages, it is the set of useful
things it lets a programmer express. This is very specific to both the 
programmer and their goals. Abstraction plays into it, but is not the whole
picture.

Abstraction is a double-edged sword. The more abstraction you choose, the less 
control you retain. E.g. GC is a great tool for memory safety, but you pay for 
it with loss of control when something is reclaimed; both in the dreaded GC 
pauses and higher memory footprint of your application. For a great deal of 
programs, this is a good tradeoff.

Old-school hackers will also know the feeling of power one gets when fully
controlling the machine, something impossible in the fluffy pampered world of
high level languages. This is yet another kind of power, and it sometimes 
allows hackers to do great and surprising things (If you haven't written any
assembly code yet, I hereby invite you to try it – a few hours should be enough
to at least get some "Hello, World" program to run, and you may well find that 
it isn't as complex as it's made up to be).

Both abstraction and power apparently are not evenly distributed. For example 
(*dons flame-retardant suit*) I argue that static typing is in a sense more 
powerful than dynamic typing, because you can express constraints with the 
former that you need to document for the latter (and hope for the best).

In another sense, (*dons another layer of asbestos*) dynamic typing is more 
powerful than static typing, because the latter will restrict the set of 
programs the compiler will accept, and that may include programs that are 
valid, but whose validity cannot be proven by (or to) the type checker. In
practice, this often trades up front fast iteration for debugging later. For
small, easy to debug programs, this is a good tradeoff.

Of course, there are dimensions of power within the type system itself (which
is after all why it's a mainstay of CS research) – e.g. Java's type system is 
more powerful than Go's, because you can express generic types in Java, whereas
you need to resort to `interface{}` and hand-waving in Go. C#'s system is still
more powerful, because it retains type information at runtime and thus can
express constraints Java cannot.

So the power *to restrict possible programs* is something that can be useful,
but (if experience is a valid guide) will mostly benefit large programs and/or
libraries. For the latter, being able to restrict usage can help as a guide
(some people call this strategy type-directed programming). On the other hand,
for small one-off scripts, its value is reduced. So far, so well-published.

It is easy to see that restricting the space of valid programs can enable a 
programmer to write things that would be infeasible without the restrictions, 
like an undirected search in open space will run out of resources long before 
reaching the goal where a directed search easily finds it.

In Rust, we have another way of restricting access: We can use the borrow
checker to require either read-only access from multiple targets or a single
target with full access. Compare this to C++, where we have but convention and
careful coding to rely on, this allows us to change code and let the compiler
[sort out the consequences](http://manishearth.github.io/blog/2015/05/03/where-rust-really-shines/).

This is so great because it frees the programmer from thinking about global 
interference of his changes, something that functional languages usually try to 
do by restricting mutable state. Since many programs require *some* state to 
run, those languages cope by either wrapping it in <s>burritos</s> monads (e.g. 
Haskell), or just allowing it anyway (e.g. Lisp, ML). In the former case, the 
type system limits the effects, while in the latter, there is nothing to 
protect you from interfering with other code in a way that may cause unforeseen 
circumstances.

That this freedom from certain concerns amplifies the power of a programmer is 
to be expected. Musicians will often train to play certain sequences by 
repeating them until they can play them *without thinking* (I believe the term 
for that is "muscle memory"). A programmer with a tool that takes care of some 
things for them will have more attention free for other things, and thus can 
manage more complex problems. If you choose Rust, you let the compiler be your 
muscle memory.

Incidentially, this also explains the popularity of Java: Current IDEs are so 
good they free programmers from caring about a lot of things, so they can focus 
on the problem at hand. In Rust, the compiler takes care of a lot of things 
that would be outright scary in another language. I'm longing for the day that 
IDEs for Rust reach the same level of maturity as they currently have for C++ 
or Java. Programming in such an environment will be *very* powerful.
