title: Causal Profiling Rust Code
---

There's a new hotness in performance measurements, and it's called causal
profiling. The idea behind it is that you want to measure how a speed up of a
certain function would impact the runtime as a whole, which can be very
counterintuitive in today's multi-threaded world.

The congenial trick to make this possible is to simulate speeding up one
portion of the code by slowing down everything else running concurrently and
subtracting the time added by the slowdown from the total.

This is all very understandably explained in a [youtube video] of a talk by one 
of the researchers who created the tool for this. Their [paper] 
<sup>(PDF)</sup> has more details.

The causal profiler is called [coz] and is written for C programs. However, the 
unstoppable Alex Crichton has taken it upon himself to port the runtime 
component to Rust, so we can use it to profile Rust code.

(Aside: I added some code so we can have a `scope!` macro that will add begin 
and end tracepoints for the current scope regardless of possible early exits. 
This is something that C cannot do, so yay for Rust!)

Now how do we actually run it? First, we have to install coz. On my system, 
this required installing the `python3-docutils` package (for the manpage) and 
the [`libelfin`] library for reading the DWARF information, which coz uses to 
identify the line of code it traces. With that out of the way, `make && make 
install` worked beautifully and I could start on my merry way.

Alex' [coz-rs] has an example, so this was the first I tried to profile:

```
coz-rs$ cargo build --release --example toy
coz-rs$ coz run --- target/release/examples/toy
```

The latter went through a whole lot of output and then saved a `profile.coz`
that I could plot with a web-based viewer (you can browse to
`file:///your/path/to/coz/viewer/index.htm`, use a [provided version] hosted on
github or set up your own local webserver). The output looks pretty neat:

This graph plots the program speedup under the assumption that the code at a
given point would be sped up by a certain amount with 100% being the complete
removal of the runtime for this range of code.

Let's look at a slightly more taxing example. The [`regex-redux`] benchmark has
a number of operations, some of which run in parallel (via rayon). This seems
a good one for coz, so I instrumented the code for latency profiling.

The first problem I ran into was that coz did not pipe through stdin to the
benchmarked executable, so I had to change the benchmark to hardcode a file
with the input text.

Next up, coz exited with an error code of 245. Looking for clues, I found that
I had missed `coz::thread_init()`. But even adding that did not help. So I
randomly commented out code sections and found that the part where we find the
replaced sequence length and count matches in parallel (using rayon to join the
threads) caused the error.

However, somewhat surprisingly, removing the threads and running the code on
the main thread did not solve the issue. Looking at the coz repo, I found
someone had submitted an issue with a different benchmark where it appeared
that jemalloc was the culprit, so I tried using the system alloc:

```rust
use std::alloc::System;

#[global_allocator]
static S: System = System;
```

However, even that did not help. Running the program without coz worked fine,
but I couldn't get it to run with coz. So I'll leave the conclusion to a future
post. Stay tuned!
