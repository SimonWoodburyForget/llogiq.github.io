title: Rust 2020 â€“ More Or Less
---

*The Rust team [asked] for 2020 roadmap blog posts, so here goes:*

Let's do more of what we've been doing so far.

More fixes, more [optimizations]. More [research] on what interesting effects 
we can create by combining existing language features. More (and more diverse) 
[teams]. More doc improvements. More blogs showing off cool things. More help 
for project maintainers and contributors. More [review]. More [mentors]. More 
meetups. More books. More [async]. More target platforms. More stabilizations. 
More completing unfinished features. More accessibility. More crates. More 
jobs. More Rustaceans!

Let's also do less.

Less snark against other languages. Less RFCs. Less drinking-from-the-firehose 
discussions. Less [`unsafe`]. Less [unsoundness]. Less [ICE]s. Less wasted disk 
space. Less empty or unmaintained crates. Less dogma. Less jargon. Less 
gatekeeping. <s>Less blockchains and cryptocurrencies</s>. Less 
[fear mongering], even from yours truly. Less using Rust to do the wrong thing, 
safely.
